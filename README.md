Debug My Heart
This is a personal Valentine's Day project called "Debugging da Thali", designed to simulate emotional bug fixing in a fun and affectionate way. It was created as a romantic gesture, reflecting the ups and downs of a relationship through a playful debugging experience.

Overview:
The website presents fictional emotional "bugs" and challenges for the love of my life to solve. Each situation mimics a real-life emotional moment, and the user must choose the right actions to "patch" the problem. It's an interactive and creative way to express love and encourage communication.

Features:
Emotional "bug" cards with choices for resolution
Real-time progress tracking of bugs fixed
Debugging sections with text inputs or multiple-choice emergency fixes 
Final message when all bugs are resolved

Technologies Used:
HTML5
CSS3 (with gradients, shadows, and keyframe animations)
Google Fonts (JetBrains Mono, Inter)
Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
Custom animations and interactive logic

Purpose:
This site is not just a gift â€” it's a symbolic way of showing that even when things feel broken, we can debug them together with love, patience, and effort.
